## Output

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `docs/reports/code-review/` | Unified review report (quality + security + performance) |

---

## Workflow

### 1. Get Commit Hash and Date
```bash
COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
FILENAME="${COMMIT_HASH}_${DATE}.md"
```

### 2. Load Template
Load `references/report-template.md` as the report structure.

### 3. Collect Issues
Collect issues from the calling agent with required fields:
- **severity**: critical | high | medium | low
- **domain**: quality | security | performance
- **confidence**: high (90%+) | medium (70-89%) | low (<70%)
- **location**: file:line
- **category**: issue classification
- **problem**: problem description
- **impact**: why it matters
- **suggestion**: how to fix
- **evidence**: code snippet or reference
- **references**: documentation links (optional)

### 4. Apply Confidence Filtering
| Confidence | Treatment |
|------------|-----------|
| High (90%+) | Include in main findings tables |
| Medium (70-89%) | Include in main findings with advisory note |
| Low (<70%) | Include in Advisory section only |

### 5. Generate Report
Apply collected data to the template and generate the markdown report.

### 6. Save Report
Save to `docs/reports/code-review/{commit_hash}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
